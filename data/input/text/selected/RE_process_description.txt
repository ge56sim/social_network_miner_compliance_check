For a medical trial and approval (MTA), pharmaceutical companies sent research approaches and results to a clinical research organization. Then the clinical research organization conduct a clinical trial and send the results back to the pharmaceutical company which forward the clinical trial protocols to the investigational review board. The board hands over the protocols to the ethics committee. Both, the investigational review board and the ethics committee review the protocols. Either the pharmaceutical company receives an acceptance and can contact pharmacies and healthcare providers, or the protocols are rejected.
