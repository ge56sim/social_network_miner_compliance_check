Prompt:

Given the following business process, identify the actors, activities, and control flow, and present the results in JSON format. Each actor should contain 'actor_id', and 'actor_name'. Each activity should contain 'activity_id'(int), and 'activity_name'(string). The 'control_flow' should be represented as a sequence of transitions with the fields:'control_flow_id'(int), 'activity_from' stores the activity being executed, 'activity_to' indicates the activity that is executed next, 'actor_performer', 'actor_receiver', 'terminating_activity' with values true or false (boolean), this is true when the activity will terminate the process, and a 'flow_type' ('sequential' or 'conditional'). Each transition stores exactly one 'actor_performer' and exactly one 'actor_receiver'. In case multiple 'actor_performer' or 'actor_receiver' exist, (e.g., for parallel activities) create multiple transitions for that activity.
